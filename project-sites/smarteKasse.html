        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>
          As a group project, we were asked to solve a problem for a small
          company. In the company there was coffee that every employee could
          get, he just had to put a line on a tally sheet so that you could
          determine how many coffees he got and how much he had to pay for it at
          the end of the month. In addition, someone had to count the individual
          tally marks and collect the money from the individual employees in
          cash to buy new coffee utensils. Our task was to find a digital
          automated solution for this.
        </p>
        <h1>Goal</h1>
        <p>
          After some concept discussions with the company it was clear to us
          that we need 2 things: a terminal where you can dial in the desired
          products after a RFID chip scanner. And a web application with a login
          function, so that the individual employees have an overview of the
          purchased products and can also pay directly. Admins can also
          create/delete employees and create/delete products.

          When I began sketching, my objective was to generate ideas for making

          individuals wouldn't have to spend an excessive amount of time
          exploring the application before comprehending its functionality.

          I used my sketches as a guide for the wireframing portion of my design

          implement a minimalistic but not boring design using the idea of the
          gray wave element.

        <h1>High-fidelity Prototype</h1>
        <p>
          I created the high fidelity prototype with Figma. The colors I have
          adapted to the company, because this has the colors black, white and
          neon yellow / green. Because the software is designed and developed
          specifically for the company. The wave element was taken over but
          assigned to the neon color to add some color to the design. The
          prototype was also expanded or deepened to give the developers a
          better idea for the implementation.
        </p>

      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <h4>Terminal</h4>
        <img src="Smartekasse/HiFi_Terminal1.png" alt="Image 1" />
        <p>
          Here you can see the start screen of the terminal, which is actually
          visible most of the time when it is not in use. Here you are clearly
          asked to identify yourself with your RFID chip. <br />
          <br />
          As soon as you have identified yourself, the interactive page of the
          terminal appears. You can select the desired products and add them to
          your account. If you change your mind during the process and don't
          want to buy, there is a "back" button to cancel the process.
        </p>

        <img src="Smartekasse/HiFi_Terminal2.png" alt="Image 2" />
        <p>
          For the High Fidelity prototype I decided to use outline icons and
          fill them as soon as they are selected. To do this, I added a number
          to the top corner, so that it is clear to the user which product and
          how often he has selected this product. Also the "add" button appears
          as soon as a product is selected.

      </div>
      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="Smartekasse/HiFi_Terminal3.png" alt="Image 3" />
        <p>
          At the end a text appears where it is noted which product and how
          often this product is now added to the user's account.
        </p>

      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <h4>Webapplication</h4>
        <img src="Smartekasse/HiFi_Web1.png" alt="Image 4" />
        <p>
          The home page of the web applications has a Home, Credit Balance,
          Administer, About Us and a Login field. I don't want to overwhelm the
          users of the site and therefore I put a small number of interactions
          on the home page. In addition, you can change the entire language of
          the page.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="Smartekasse/HiFi_Web2.png" alt="Image 5" />
        <p>
          The account balance page contains a graph with the number and
          description of the added products, in a month. Below is the "Payment"
          button where you can choose among different payment methods. <br />
          <br />

          On the right side there is something like a receipt. It is listed what
          and how much was added on each day, to offer the user an overview. At
          the bottom you can see the total cost of the month. Of course, it is
          possible to select other months and not only the current month to
          view.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="Smartekasse/HiFi_Web3.png" alt="Image 6" />
        <p>
          For the admins there is an extra function "Manage" which only they can
          see. Here you can manage employees or products.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="Smartekasse/HiFi_Web4.png" alt="Image 7" />
        <p>
          The two sides differ only in the property employee and product. For
          both you can create employees or products and also search, manage and
          delete them.

        <h1>What did I learn</h1>
        <p>
          Smart Checkout, was the first project where I actually worked with a
          company and designed something for them. I was a bit nervous at the
          beginning, as I didn't have a detailed design brief or an existing
          design to reference. However, I quickly realized that I had a good
          understanding of the user context and goals, as I was designing an
          application to solve a problem that I could personally relate to. The
          project was a lot of fun because I was able to solve a real problem
          and I also had a lot of creative freedom.
